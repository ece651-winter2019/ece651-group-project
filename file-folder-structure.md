This file documents the process to create consensus over the folder-file structure that we will follow for our repo.

A nice starting point is suggested [here](https://github.com/kriasoft/Folder-Structure-Conventions):

Example

* build # Compiled files (alternatively `dist`)
  * database
  * backend
  * frontend
  * mobileapp
  * ci
* docs # Documentation files (alternatively `doc`)
  * softdev lifecycle
    * planning
    * requirements
    * design
    * implementation
    * testing
    * deployment
    * maintenance
* src # Source files (alternatively `lib` or `app`)
* test # Automated tests (alternatively `spec` or `tests`)
* tools # Tools and utilities
* LICENSE
* README.md
