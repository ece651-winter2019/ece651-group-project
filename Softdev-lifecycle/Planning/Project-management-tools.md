## Methods and tools for project management

General goal of our project is to learn how to implement software engineering approach in a software development process. We will be focused on organizing our activities in such a manner, such that our work will be efficient and of high quality. 

The chosen development model will be evolutionary iterative. This approach will allows us to work step by step towards a final required specfication list appropriate for the health management system. At the beginning of each step we will specify new requirements for the given period of time and then go through the complete process of design, coding, testing and release. Thanks to that, our system will be growing from a simple minimum viable product with basic functionalities to one of a final complexity, reachable in the given time limit.

The length of our project sprints will be two weeks with regular weekly meetings where we will be discussing any issues or difficulties experienced during the current sprint and feedback based on the progress in previous sprints. Upcoming milestones will then be re-evaluated and the task list will be re-prioritized. Tasks will be defined in a form of user stories. Not yet implemented ideas will be added to a backlog as well. Abandoned tasks will be archived and commented on as to why the tasks were abandoned.

Since our software includes development of web and mobile applications, part of our project will be prototyping. We will create several wire frames to simulate user interfaces.

We will be using agile techniques for team collaboration with the advantage of parallel working, so that the development of our software is more efficient. Each team member will be responsible for a specific part of the development process, according to his skills and previous experience. In order to get feedback from team members working on closely related tasks, there will be on demand meetings.

Communication within our team is supported by Slack, allowing us to divide the chats into channels based on the topic â€“ general, cloud server development, app development etc.

All our work will be managed via Github. We will use its tools for creating shared documents, keeping track of our progress and mainly for version control of our source code.
